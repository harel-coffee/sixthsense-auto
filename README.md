Debugging Convergence Problems in Probabilistic Programs via Program Representation Learning

SixthSense is a novel approach for predicting probabilistic program convergence ahead of run and its application to debugging convergence problems in probabilistic programs. SixthSenseâ€™s training algorithm learns a classifier that can predict whether a previously unseen probabilistic program will converge.
